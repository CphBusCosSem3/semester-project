## Thread recap 2nd of May
The **2nd of May at 8:30** I'll give a recap on threads (and a bit of networking). Thread will be a heavy topic for the exam (and very important for your career), so this is your chance to brush up the topic and sort out anything that is not clear to you. I will try to make it a bit more hands-on and give you some funny examples on concurrency.

I **strongly** encourage you to participate and use this to measure your level of ''exam-readiness'': if you understand everything and can use this in your daily jobs, you are good to go! If not, this is the time to start using threads! (hint: the semester project is perfect for this).

For those of you that read this: please spread the word. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the **2nd of May 8:30**. I promise I'll be there. This time. I hope.
